<h1 id="usage">Usage</h1>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>optoConfig-96 is a program to interactively create protocols for the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41596-019-0178-y">optoPlate-96 illumination device</a>. It should get you up and running quickly, while providing enough flexibility for complex illumination protocols.</p>
<p>The general workflow to create an illumination protocol looks as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Create <strong>Steps</strong>. A Step is the basic building block for all subsequent stages and defines illumination parameters for an LED.</li>
<li>Assemble <strong>Programs</strong> from Steps. One step can be a part of different programs.</li>
<li>Assign programs to <strong>LEDs</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Export</strong> the code and upload it to the Arduino controlling the optoPlate-96.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="quick-start">Quick Start</h3>
<p>This section will briefly explain how to execute the basic workflow.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Upon launching the application, the <em>Plate Configuration</em> dialog will open. Here, you can specify if you want to configure the 1-, 2- or 3-color variant of the optoPlate-96.</li>
<li>Create a new Step in the Step list, or select an existing one. Adjust the Step parameters as desired.</li>
<li>Create a new Program in the Program list, or use an existing one. Select the Program you wish to assign the selected Step to.</li>
<li>Below the Step list, click <em>Assign</em> to add the selected Step to the selected Program. Alternatively, right-click the Step and choose <em>Assign selected to Program…</em>. You can use the same Step multiple times in the same Program, and you can use the same Step in different Programs.</li>
<li>Select the well to which you would like to assign your Program. Below the Program List, select the relevant LED you wish to assign your Program to. Then, click <em>Assign</em> below the Program List. Alternatively, right click the Program and choose <em>Assign program to selected wells…</em>. You can use the same Program for multiple LEDs and wells.</li>
<li>Choose <em>File &gt; Export Code …</em> to generate and display the Arduino code. Copy the code into the Arduino IDE and connect the Arduino controlling the optoPlate to your computer. In the Arduino IDE, choose “Arduino Micro” under <em>Tools &gt; Board</em>, and select the port to which the board is connected under <em>Tools &gt; Port</em>. Then upload by choosing <em>Sketch &gt; Upload</em>. For more help on uploading code to the Arduino, see <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Environment#uploading">the Arduino reference</a>.</li>
<li>You are done!</li>
</ol>
<p>If you identify issues during configurating or running your illumination protocols, please contact us!</p>
<p>Please note that LEDs may light up erratically if power is restored to the Arduino Micro via the optoPlate-96 while it is connected to a computer by a Micro-USB cable. To restore proper functionality, press the reset button on the Arduino, or disconnect the Arduino from your computer and turn the power off and back on again.</p>

<h3 id="step-list">Step List</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The Step list holds all defined Steps and displays information about them in a tabular format. Steps are the building blocks of Programs. Note that a Step is color-agnostic, i.e. it does not know about the LED it is controlling. Steps have a name and are defined by four parameters (duration, intensity, pulse ON time, pulse OFF time). The time parameters are limited to a resolution of 100 ms and can not be longer than 4294967200 ms (approximately 49 days).</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="step-parameters">Step Parameters</h4>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Name:</em></p>
<p>A name for the Step to easily find it in the Step list.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Duration:</em></p>
<p>The total duration of the Step.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Intensity:</em></p>
<p>Intensity of the Step, in arbitrary units from 0 (off) to 4095 (maximum intensity). For pulsed Steps, this is the intensity during the ON phases. During the OFF phases, the intensity is 0. If desired, you may set conversion factors for each LED under <em>Configuration &gt; Configure Plate…</em>, in order to display a conversion to physical units. <strong>The converted values are only for illustration purposes and do not affect the generated Arduino code of optoConfig-96!</strong></p></li>
<li><p><em>Pulsed:</em></p>
<p>Indicates if the Step is a pulsed Step or a constant Step. Pulsed Steps always begin in the ON phase. If you need a Step to start with its OFF phase, you can add the Step to a Program and precede it with another Step of intensity 0 and the duration of the OFF phase.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>ON:</em> The duration of the ON phases.</p></li>
<li><p><em>OFF:</em> The duration of the OFF phases.</p></li>

<p><em>The Steps (assembled in a Program) generated by these settings.</em></p>
<p>Opens a dialog in which new Steps can be created by linearly interpolating between boundaries for each parameter. The default values for the start and end values correspond to the parameters of the first and last selected Step, respectively. Interpolation can be used to quickly create a gradient illumination pattern, for instance with increasing or decreasing intensity over time.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Name:</em></p>
<p>Set a prefix to use for generated Steps. The settings shown above will generate Steps with names Interpolation_1, Interpolation_2, …</p></li>

<li><p><em>Interpolation steps</em>:</p>
<p>The number of Steps to generate by linear interpolation.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Assign all to program:</em></p>
<p>When this option is selected, a new Program is created which will contain all of the generated Steps in sequence.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Assign each to program:</em></p>
<p>When this option is selected, a new Program is created <em>for each individual Step</em>. This can be useful if you want to define gradients across multiple wells. Quickly assigning different programs to wells can be achieved by using the <em>Bulk assign</em> operation, see section <em>Program List</em> for details.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><em>Assign Selected to Program…:</em></p>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Range Slider:</em></p>
<p>The slider allows setting the X axis limits, which may be useful to verify short pulsing times for very long steps. In this case, individual pulses may no longer be clearly discernible. To the right of the range slider, the time unit to use for the plot’s X axis can be selected in the dropdown menu.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Show pulsed:</em></p>
<p>When this option is turned off, the Step will not be displayed as pulsed. This can be useful for Steps which are very long, with very short pulsing times. This also affects how the Step is displayed in the Program Editor or the Well Viewer, when pulsing display is defined <em>Per Step</em> there. Pulsed Steps which are shown unpulsed are plotted with the ON phase intensity - no averaging is performed.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Color:</em></p>
<p>The color used to plot the Step in the Step and Program Editors. The default colors are selected randomly and do not relate to the LED color.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Range Slider:</em></p>
<p>The slider allows setting the X axis limits, which may be useful to inspect short and long Steps in the same Program. To the right of the range slider, the time unit to use for the plot’s X axis can be selected in the dropdown menu.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Show pulsing for:</em></p>
<p>Set this to determine how pulsing cycles are displayed. Depending on the duration of Steps in relation to their pulse on and off duration, the plot may appear visually cluttered, so disabling the pulse display may make it easier to discern. Note that even if pulses are not shown for a particular Step, it is plotted with a dashed line to indicate it is pulsed. Pulsed Steps which are shown unpulsed are plotted with the ON phase intensity - no averaging is performed.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>All Steps:</em></p>
<p>Pulsing is shown for all Steps in the Program.</p></li>
<li><p><em>No Steps:</em></p>
<p>Pulsing is shown for no Steps in the Program.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Define per Step:</em></p>
<p>Determine whether to show a Step pulsed by the <em>Show pulsed</em> setting of the respective Step.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><em>Limit cycles, Max cycles:</em></p>
<p>When this option is activated, the number of pulsing cycles that can be shown is capped at <em>max cycles</em>. As long as all Steps in the active Program taken together do not undergo more pulsing cycles than the specified maximum, pulsing is plotted. When this value is exceeded, Steps are shown as constant to speed up the display. By default, this is set to 100. In this case, adding e.g. four Steps with 30 pulsing cycles each would disable pulse plotting for the program.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Switch off LED:</em></p>
<p>After completion of all Steps, the LED to which this Program is assigned is turned off.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Repeat the last step:</em></p>
<p>After completion of all Steps, the last Step in the Program is repeated indefinitely. While it is not possible to export Programs with a total Step duration of more than the maximum (approximately 49 days), this limit may in principle be reached if a Step is set to repeat at the end of the Program. However, <strong>program durations of more than 49 days are not supported</strong>!</p></li>

<h3 id="exporting">Exporting</h3>
<p>After defining Steps, creating Programs and assigning them to LEDs, the experimental setup is now ready to be exported to a code file that can be uploaded to the Arduino. To do this, choose <em>File &gt; Export Code …</em>. You can either copy the code and paste it into the Arduino IDE yourself, or choose <em>Open in IDE</em> to launch the Arduino IDE. Connect the Arduino controlling the optoPlate to your computer. In the Arduino IDE, choose “Arduino Micro” under <em>Tools &gt; Board</em>, and select the port to which the board is connected under <em>Tools &gt; Port</em>. Then upload by choosing <em>Sketch &gt; Upload</em>. For more help on uploading code to the Arduino, see <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Environment#uploading">the Arduino reference</a>.</p>
<p>Before uploading the code to the Arduino, you may wish to test or inspect your configuration. <a href="#simulate-experiment">To do so, choose <em>File &gt; Simulate Experiment …</em></a>.</p>
<p>Please note that LEDs may light up erratically if power is restored to the Arduino Micro while it is connected to a computer via a Micro-USB cable.

<p><em>Exported csv opened in a spreadsheet software</em></p>
<p>The exported csv has one row for each well, LED type and Step, and columns for Program and Step parameters. The following columns are exported:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>well</em></p>
<p>Name of the well.</p></li>
<li><p><em>led</em></p>
<p>Name of the LED.</p></li>
<li><p><em>program</em></p>
<p>Name of the Program assigned to this well and LED.</p></li>
<li><p><em>program_id</em></p>
<p>ID of the Program assigned to this well and LED.</p></li>
<li><p><em>total_steps</em></p>
<p>The number of steps in the Program assigned to this well and LED.</p></li>
<li><p><em>step</em></p>
<p>Each Step in a Program results in the generation of an additional row. This column holds the name of the Step.</p></li>
<li><p><em>step_no</em></p>
<p>The total number of Steps in the Program.</p></li>
<li><p><em>step_id</em></p>
<p>The ID of the Step.</p></li>
<li><p><em>step_start_time</em></p>
<p>The time (in ms) after which this Step starts.</p></li>
<li><p><em>step_duration</em></p>
<p>The duration (in ms) of the Step.</p></li>
<li><p><em>step_intensity</em></p>
<p>The LED intensity (in arbitrary units, from 0 to 4095) of the Step.</p></li>
<li><p><em>step_pulsed</em></p>
<p>‘yes’ if the Step is a pulsed Step, or ‘no’ if it is not.</p></li>
<li><p><em>step_pulse_on</em></p>
<p>The pulse on duration of the Step (in ms).</p></li>
<li><p><em>step_pulse_off</em></p>
<p>The pulse off duration of the Step (in ms).</p></li>
<li><p><em>step_repeat</em></p>
<p>For the last Step in the Program, this is ‘yes’ if the Program is set to repeat its last Step, or ‘no’ if not. For Steps which are not the last Step in the Program, this is always ‘no’.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Grouping:</em></p>
<p>You can choose to assign Programs to each of the 96 wells of the optoPlate individually (<em>96-well</em>), or you can select (<em>24-well</em>) to perform assignment to groups of 4 wells, mimicking the layout of a 24-well plate. Note that changing the Grouping setting will reset all Program assignments.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Plate Colors:</em></p>
<p>You can set which configuration of the optoPlate-96 you are using: the 1-color, 2-color or 3-color variant.</p></li>
<li><p><em>LED types:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Name:</em></p>
<p>The name of the LED is used in the Program Assignment table and the Well Viewer and is only relevant for display purposes.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Color:</em></p>
<p>The color assigned to an LED is used in the Program Assignment table and for the plots in the Well Viewer. It is only relevant for display purposes.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Convert, Conversion factor, Unit:</em></p>
<p>If desired, a conversion factor can be entered to convert arbitrary units to physical units. This is shown in the Step Editor and can facilitate setting the necessary intensity for a Step. It is only relevant for display purposes, however, and has no effect on the exported intensities.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Correction file:</em></p>
<p>You can specify the path to a .csv file which holds correction factors for LEDs. The file should be a comma-separated list of values, which can be exported from standard spreadsheet software. In both Microsoft Excel or LibreOffice Calc, .csv files can be saved by choosing <em>File &gt; Save As</em> and selecting .csv as the file type. The layout of the table must correspond to the layout of a multi-well plate (table rows to plate rows, table columns to plate columns).</p>
<p>Each correction factor is a multiplication factor between 0.0 and 1.0. When a Program runs on the optoPlate, each intensity is first multiplied by the correction factor before it is written to the LED. When a valid file was specified, the correction matrix can be shown with the <em>Show</em> button. This feature can be used to reduce illumination differences between different wells, or to easily define intensity gradients over multiple wells of the plate, without having to define many Steps and Programs - simply assign the same Program to all LEDs and let the correction handle the creation of the gradient.</p>
<p>Note that each LED type has its own correction factors and that they are not shared!</p>

<h4 id="set-fan-speed">Set Fan Speed</h4>
<p>You can adjust the fan speed of the fan on the optoPlate from 0 (off) to 255 (maximum speed). The default value is 255. The fan speed needed to provide sufficient cooling will depend on the heat generated by the optoPlate during the protocol, which depends on the number of activated LEDs and their intensities.</p>
